# Getting-started-with-machine-learning
This project walks beginners through the basic steps of a machine learning workflow, including loading a dataset from a CSV file, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. We'll use a simple dataset like the Boston Housing dataset or another publicly available CSV file with tabular data.
